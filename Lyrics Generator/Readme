Lyrics Generation with Deep Learning

This file contains information about code for generating song lyrics using deep learning techniques. 
The model is trained on Taylor Swift's song lyrics dataset and can generate new lyrics based on the provided input.

Introduction
This project focuses on creating a deep learning model to generate song lyrics in the style of Taylor Swift.
The model is built using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks and trained on a dataset comprising Taylor Swift's song lyrics. 
It preprocesses the lyrics data, including removing stopwords, punctuations, and lemmatization, before training the model.

**Install the required dependencies:**

```
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy nltk wordcloud keras
```

3. Download NLTK resources:

```
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')
```

## Usage

The `lyrics_generation.py` script contains all the code for data preprocessing, model training, and generating lyrics.
Here's how to use it:

1. Run the script:

```
python lyrics_generation.py
```

2. The script preprocesses the lyrics data by removing stopwords, punctuations, and lemmatizing the words. 
It then trains two LSTM models: a unidirectional LSTM model (`lyrics_generator_model1`) and a bidirectional LSTM model (`lyrics_generator_model2`).
The trained models are saved in the current directory.

3. You can then use the provided functions `predict_seq` and `pred2_seq` to generate lyrics using the trained models.

## Models

Two models are trained in this project:

1. `lyrics_generator_model1`: A unidirectional LSTM model.
2. `lyrics_generator_model2`: A bidirectional LSTM model.

Both models are trained on the same dataset but may produce slightly different results due to architectural differences.
