Overview
This project aims to predict diseases based on symptoms using machine learning techniques.
It utilizes a dataset containing information about various diseases and their associated symptoms. 
The primary focus is on implementing two classification algorithms: Gaussian Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

Dataset
The dataset (Dataset asli.csv) contains information about diseases and their corresponding symptoms. 
Upon loading the dataset, unique diseases and symptoms are extracted for further analysis and model training.
Missing values in the dataset are handled by imputing them with the mode value of each column.

Data Visualization
Data visualization is performed using seaborn and matplotlib libraries to gain insights into the distribution of symptoms across different diseases.
A scatter plot is generated to visualize the relationship between individual symptoms and diseases.


Machine Learning Models
Gaussian Naive Bayes
A Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier is trained on the dataset after splitting it into training and testing sets. 
The model is evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, a confusion matrix and heatmap are generated to visualize the model's performance.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
A K-Nearest Neighbors classifier is implemented with a specified number of neighbors (k=32).
Similar to Gaussian Naive Bayes, the KNN model is trained, evaluated, and visualized using the same set of performance metrics, confusion matrix, and heatmap.
