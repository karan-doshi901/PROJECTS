The script begins by importing necessary libraries such as pandas, NLTK, re, string, matplotlib, wordcloud, and sklearn. It then reads a CSV file named “data.csv” into a pandas DataFrame. The main focus of the script is on the “review” column of the DataFrame.

The preprocessing steps include converting all reviews to lowercase and removing punctuation. The script also implements word tokenization, where it breaks down the text into individual words. It removes stop words (commonly used words that are filtered out) from the reviews.

The script then applies lemmatization, which reduces words to their base or root form. For example, “running” becomes “run”. This is done using the WordNetLemmatizer from NLTK.

The script also includes data visualization steps. It creates a histogram of word counts and a word cloud to visualize the most frequently used words in the reviews.

Finally, the script performs sentiment analysis on the reviews using the SentimentIntensityAnalyzer from NLTK. It calculates a sentiment score for each review and adds these scores to the DataFrame in a new column named “Sentiment”.

The script also contains a list of aspects that seem to be used for further analysis, but the code related to these aspects is not included in the provided script.

This script is a comprehensive example of how to perform basic Natural Language Processing tasks such as preprocessing, tokenization, lemmatization, visualization, and sentiment analysis on a text dataset.
